# Hello!

## UX


This e-commerce product page. My challenge it was to build out this e-commerce product page to show what I've have learnt. Users can add the product in the cart, delete the product and to checkout the product.


### User Stories

-  As a site visitor, I want to see new content when I come to the site, so I come back more ofen. 
-  As a site visitor, I want to know as I glance around the home page what on earth a CSM is and why I'd want to be one so that I read more.
-  As a site visitor, I want to be able to get back to the home page quickly and easily, so I donâ€™t get lost navigating and so the site works like every other site in the world.
-  As a site visitor, I can browse a catalog of all products available so that I can pick the right one for me.
-  As a site visitor, I can see a list of other related products when viewing a product so that I can see other products I might be interested in. 
-  As a site visitor, I can put products in my shopping cart so that I can purchase them.
-  As a buyer, I receive a receipt for any product I pay for so that I can prove I paid for it. 
-  As a site visitor, I can sign up for a newsletter so that I get announcements about new products and other information. 
-  As a user, I want to have the application respond quickly to my actions so that I don't get bored.


### Wireframes

I drew my wireframes using Balsamiq. I have done two wireframes for each page to show my consideration of how to make my website responsive. The links to the files are below:

### Technologies Used
**Balsamiq** - I've used Balsamiq to create wireframes of my website before building the actual site.

**HTML5** - The project uses HTML5 to create the basic elements and content of my game.

**CSS3** - The project uses CSS3 to add custom styles to the elements and content of my game.

**Git**  - I've used Git as a version control system to regularly add and commit changes made to project in Cloud9, before pushing them to GitHub.

**Google Fonts** - The project uses Google Fonts to style the text and suit my chosen theme

**GitHub** - I've used GitHub as a remote repository to push and store the committed changes to my project from Git. I've also used GitHub pages to deploy my game in a live environment.

**Font Awesome** - The project uses Font Awesome for the various icons in my app.



#### Responsive Testing

- I used Google Chrome's Development tools to constantly test each change that I made to my website and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. I also tested my website on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop) to ensure it appeared in the desired way on different devices.
- To test my whole website, I went through each page, feature by feature, and documented the results on a spreadsheet. The spreadsheet also documents any responsive features and confirms that they work and appear as intended on different screen sizes.

### HTMl and CSS Validation
- I used the [W3C HTML Validator](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) to validate my HTMl code.
- i used the[W3c CSS Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input) to validate my CSS code.

### Deployment
The hosting platform that I've used for my project is GitHub Pages. To deploy my website to GitHub pages, I used the following steps:
Loaded the terminal window in my Cloud9 workspace.

Initialised Git using the git init command.

Added all files to the Staging area (Git) using the git add . command.

Committed the files to Git using the git commit -m "Initial commit" command.

Created a new repository in GitHub called 'Project 3'.

Copied the below code from GitHub into the terminal window in my Cloud9 workspace:

git remote add origin https://github.com/PelteaLeonard/Project3

git push -u origin master

Entered my GitHub username and password to push the files from Git to GitHub.

Went into 'Settings' on my repository page in GitHub.

Selected the 'master branch' option under the 'GitHub Pages' section.

Ran several regular commits throughout my project.
